# Analysis of Malaria Incidence in Uganda 

## Introduction

This repository contains code, configuration, and reports regarding the analysis
of Malaria incidence in Uganda. The main analysis utilizes survey data collected
from participants in Uganda, laboratory measures, and geospatial information. 

## Data

The data is in a HIPAA-compliant database that won't be accessible. There are 4 different survey time ponts where Net usage and Malaria prevalence is measured within a county in Uganda.

## Code

The code/ folder contains the data management (`data_manage.R` and `manage_modis.R`) code along with the analysis code (`analysis.R`). The manuscript is written in a `.Rmd` format (in `report/SpatialAnalysisMagoro.Rmd`).

## TODO

The next steps regarding the analysis is included in the root folder as `TODO.md` file.
